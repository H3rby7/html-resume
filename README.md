# Customization Ideas

* Change your name `letter-spacing` to fit into and fill your title line precisely.
* Need the indentation of the icon width? -> use an empty icon `<i class="fa-solid"></i>`.
* Explore/Find icons: https://fontawesome.com/search?ic=free&o=r
* Adjust the `--sidebar-width` to fit your information exactly, so the left section gets more space.
* Change the colors (to match with the CI of the job-source).
* Combine the sections "Experiences" and "Education"
