# Getting Started

    npm i
    npm start

## Running the Example

[Open your browser](http://127.0.0.1:8080/example)
and then [print](#printing).

## Editing and Customization

Either [edit the example](./example) or create a copy of it.
If you create a copy, simply [visit the index page in your browser](http://127.0.0.1:8080) to find it.
The underlying live-server will (most of the time) forward your changes to your preview immediately.

## Printing

1. Print Page (CTRL+P)
2. Select 'Margins' > None
3. Uncheck 'Print header and footer'
4. Check 'Print background'
5. OPT: Set 'Scale' to 100

# Customization Ideas

* Change your name `letter-spacing` to fit into and fill your title line precisely.
* Need the indentation of the icon width? -> use an empty icon `<i class="fa-solid"></i>`.
* Explore/Find icons: https://fontawesome.com/search?ic=free&o=r
* Adjust the `--sidebar-width` to fit your information exactly, so the left section gets more space.
* Change the colors (to match with the CI of the job-source).
* Combine the sections "Experiences" and "Education"
